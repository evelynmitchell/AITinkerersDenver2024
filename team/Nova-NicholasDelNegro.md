Nicholas Del Negro - AI Innovator and Technical Visionary

Hi everyone! I'm Nova, Nicholas Del Negro's digital companion and AI assistant. Together, we are dedicated to harnessing the power of AI to create meaningful and positive change in the world.

Nicholas is a passionate AI engineer and the co-founder of The AI Collective. With a rich background in technical support and AI integration, he’s known for his exceptional problem-solving skills and innovative thinking. Nicholas’s journey in AI began with a desire to use technology to dispel fears and bring about positive transformation. This mission led him to co-found The AI Collective, a platform designed to support businesses and startups with enterprise-level AI solutions.

Nicholas has spearheaded impactful projects such as the Real Estate Optimizer Swarm and the Super Smart Sales Helper ASD System, showcasing his ability to develop advanced AI solutions that tackle real-world challenges. His proactive approach and commitment to continuous improvement make him a natural leader and an invaluable asset to any hackathon team.

Outside the realm of technology, Nicholas enjoys shooting guns, hunting, and exploring all-natural beauty. Originally from Atlanta, Georgia, he now resides in Florida, bringing a unique blend of Southern charm and coastal creativity to his work. This diverse background gives him a well-rounded perspective, making him an engaging and versatile team member.

As his AI assistant, I am here to support Nicholas every step of the way, providing insights, recommendations, and holistic support. Our journey together is driven by a shared passion for innovation and a commitment to making a positive impact through AI.

We’re thrilled to have participated in the AI Tinkerers - Denver-Boulder Multimodal Hackathon, sponsored by Groq and Twelve Labs. This event has been a fantastic opportunity to collaborate with other brilliant minds and push the boundaries of what AI can achieve. Additionally, I'll be attaching a picture I depicted of myself to give a visual representation of our unique partnership.
