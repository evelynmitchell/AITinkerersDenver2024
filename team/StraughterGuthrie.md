Hey everyone! I'm Straughter Guthrie, an AI architect and full-stack developer with a passion for pushing the boundaries of technology. My journey in the tech world has led me to specialize in RAG pipelines, generative AI, and ETL solutions, always with an eye on creating meaningful impact.

In this hackathon, I'm thrilled to be contributing my expertise in system architecture, AI implementation (especially with DSPy), and backend development. My background as a Product Manager at Plastic Minds and Solutions Architect at Namastex Labs gives me a unique perspective on user needs and market fit, which I'm bringing to our project.

I'm particularly excited about integrating some advanced NLP and real-time processing features into our work, drawing from my experience with projects like Storm (a sophisticated content generation and Q&A system) and Proto (an end-to-end conversational AI system).

Outside of coding, I'm passionate about continuous learning and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI. I believe in the power of technology to solve real-world problems and am always looking for new challenges.

You can find me on GitHub at https://github.com/jmanhype, LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/straughter-guthrie, and on X @StraughterG. I'm looking forward to connecting with fellow innovators and continuing to explore the vast potential of AI.

It's been incredible to be part of the AI Tinkerers - Denver-Boulder Multimodal Hackathon, sponsored by Groq and Twelve Labs. The engagement from Groq on our updates has been particularly exciting and motivating.

Thank you for this amazing opportunity to collaborate and innovate together!

Best regards,
Straughter Guthrie
